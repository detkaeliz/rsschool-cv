## About me

Hello!
I won't write a long lecture about myself.
Initially, I was engaged in web design. I studied it for a long time.

Today I am still quite new to programming, but with successful steps I strive to master this skill. There is some minimal knowledge, but just a little bit :)

On the recommendation of one wonderful person, I came to the RS school and gradually delve into this world.

Something like this! :) Everything is possible!
